## Description :speech_balloon:
A short project to brush up on JavaScript.

Vanilla JavaScript.

Download and configure Node.js, if you haven't before. Then you can run in your local IDE, I used VS Code.

## Credits :pray:
I was inspired by Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer career path &mdash; shout out to that course for being interactive and practical.
